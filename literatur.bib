abstract = {We present an algorithm that computes exact maximum flows and minimum-cost flows on directed graphs with m edges and polynomially bounded integral demands, costs, and capacities in (m^{1+o(1)}) time. Our algorithm builds the flow through a sequence of (m^{1+o(1)}) approximate undirected minimum-ratio cycles, each of which is computed and processed in amortized (m^{o(1)}) time using a new dynamic graph data structure. Our framework extends to algorithms running in (m^{1+o(1)}) time for computing flows that minimize general edge-separable convex functions to high accuracy. This gives almost-linear time algorithms for several problems including entropy-regularized optimal transport, matrix scaling, p-norm flows, and p-norm isotonic regression on arbitrary directed acyclic graphs.},
